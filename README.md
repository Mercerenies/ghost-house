# "ghost-house"

*Name to be determined*

This is a WIP game about haunted houses. The player character works
for a private investigation firm that specializes in crimes committed
by ghosts. Pick a haunted house (procedurally generated) and
investigate it. Talk to all of the ghosts, get their statements, find
out who the guilty party is (some ghosts will lie to you), and accuse
them. Meanwhile, there are lots of obstacles like haunted furniture
and shadow monsters hiding about in the house.

## Goals

 * A good-looking procedural generation system for making haunted houses.
 * A large library of logic puzzles to "investigate" and solve, all
   checked by a Prolog validation script.
 * Enemies that prioritize adding to the "creepy" feel of the haunted
   house, as opposed to just blindly assaulting the player.
