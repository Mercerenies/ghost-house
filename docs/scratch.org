* SPECIAL FURNITURE PLACEMENT
  To determine if we can put furniture at a given position.

  1. If there's already a player / entity there, obviously the answer
     is no.
  2. Otherwise, make a list of all adjacent (and corner-adjacent)
     cells to the potential placement.
  3. Traverse all of these cells in clockwise order. You should find
     at most one contiguous segment of "unblocked" cells and at most
     one contiguous segment of "blocked" cells. If so, yes. If not,
     no.

  Note: "blocked" is defined as being either a wall or occupied by an
  entity of any kind. "unblocked", of course, means not blocked.

* THOUGHTS
** "Evil" Rooms
   + Some rooms (very small probability) will randomly just have all
     of the furniture be evil and maybe have more bad guys too.
** More Exciting "Evil" Effects
   + Vanishing Furniture that can attack on inspection is cool and
     all, but some other stuff may be neat.
     - Chairs that get up and throw themselves at you when you pass.
     - Bookshelves that spawn books to fly at you.
     - Fairies that emit light and "hide" in furniture.
** Shadow Players
  + Appears randomly several steps behind the player, mocks the
    player's movements at a relatively slow fixed rate in an attempt
    to catch up to them. Deals damage and disappears on contact, or
    after a certain amount of time.
** DONE Running into the Wall
   Minor bug with the player running. If holding the run button, the
   player continues to consume stamina even if facing a wall or other
   impassible object. Need to fix this.
