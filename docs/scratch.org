* SPECIAL FURNITURE PLACEMENT
  To determine if we can put furniture at a given position.

  1. If there's already a player / entity there, obviously the answer
     is no.
  2. Otherwise, make a list of all adjacent (and corner-adjacent)
     cells to the potential placement.
  3. Traverse all of these cells in clockwise order. You should find
     at most one contiguous segment of "unblocked" cells and at most
     one contiguous segment of "blocked" cells. If so, yes. If not,
     no.

  Note: "blocked" is defined as being either a wall or occupied by an
  entity of any kind. "unblocked", of course, means not blocked.

* THOUGHTS
** "Evil" Rooms
   + Some rooms (very small probability) will randomly just have all
     of the furniture be evil and maybe have more bad guys too.
** More Exciting "Evil" Effects
   + Vanishing Furniture that can attack on inspection is cool and
     all, but some other stuff may be neat.
     - [X] Chairs that get up and throw themselves at you when you pass.
     - [X] Bookshelves that spawn books to fly at you.
     - [X] Fairies that emit light and "hide" in furniture.
     - [X] Washers and dryers fling themselves at you.
** DONE Shadow Players
  + Appears randomly several steps behind the player, mocks the
    player's movements at a relatively slow fixed rate in an attempt
    to catch up to them. Deals damage and disappears on contact, or
    after a certain amount of time.
** DONE Running into the Wall
   Minor bug with the player running. If holding the run button, the
   player continues to consume stamina even if facing a wall or other
   impassible object. Need to fix this.
** Stuff on Tabletops
   Surfaces like dining tables or dressers may be able to contain
   things. Generally for decoration purposes, but these things may
   also produce light.

   Possible "things" to be on surfaces
   + [ ] Torches
   + [ ] Lamps
   + [ ] Books
** The Leprechaun
   So not an actual enemy. Just a persistent background object that
   runs around to different rooms doing fun stuff when the player's
   viewport leaves the room.
   + Opening and closing all boxes in the room
   + Filling or emptying all laundry baskets in the room
   + Flipping all chairs to face the opposite way
   + Flipping all chairs upside down
   + Changing the designs of the rugs
** DONE Coherence
   If matching counters or sinks are next to each other, consider
   having them change images to look like they're part of a larger
   piece.
   + Note: Probably not if they're vanishing though.
   + Done for kitchens / bathroom / washroom
** Visuals
   Some brief video animations to play on the television and
   (eventually) projector screen.
** DONE Book Behavior
   Flying books may want to run away from the flashlight too, like
   flying clothes. Not to a hiding place but... just away.
** Occupational Ghosts
   Ghosts that spawn (maybe as ambients, maybe next to furniture) in
   specific rooms.
   + A chef in kitchens who throws knives at you.
   + A butler in dining rooms / halls who throws something at you.
   + A maid in the wardrobe room or laundry room who throws something
     at you.
   + A lady of the house in the bedroom or wardrobe room who throws
     something at you.
** Black Cat
   No haunted house is complete without one. Ambient. Appears in the
   corner of the screen and wanders around. Relatively harmless and
   runs away from the player. If cornered may attack.
