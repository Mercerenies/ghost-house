* SPECIAL FURNITURE PLACEMENT
  To determine if we can put furniture at a given position.

  1. If there's already a player / entity there, obviously the answer
     is no.
  2. Otherwise, make a list of all adjacent (and corner-adjacent)
     cells to the potential placement.
  3. Traverse all of these cells in clockwise order. You should find
     at most one contiguous segment of "unblocked" cells and at most
     one contiguous segment of "blocked" cells. If so, yes. If not,
     no.

  Note: "blocked" is defined as being either a wall or occupied by an
  entity of any kind. "unblocked", of course, means not blocked.
